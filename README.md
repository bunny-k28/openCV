# openCVirtual_paint
1. This is a python program for making "object" detection and virtual-painting over camera (or web camera) and many more.

2. First of all let me tell you that here, "object" means any thing... this is not a TensorFlow program... Therefore this program can can not identify and highlight that object type.

3. If you want to change the colors of your virtual paint then visit or paste this web-site link www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html and chose your RGB color codes and paste that in the colorContor list.

4. Please make sure you copy or type the color codes according to BGR format which is Blue Green Red.
