# openCVirtual_paint
This is a python program for making "object" detection and virtual-painting over camera (or web camera) and many more.
First of all let me tell you that here, "object" means any thing... this is not a TensorFlow program... Therefore this program can can not identify and highlight that object type.
If you want to change the colors of your virtual paint then visit or paste this web-site link www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html
